### Phase 1: Genesis Launch

* **Start Renet Ai, establish a website, documentation and socials:** In this initial phase of the Renet Ai roadmap, the focus is on establishing the foundational elements of the project: launching the official website, creating comprehensive documentation, and setting up social media channels. This step is crucial for building the Renet Ai community, providing clear and accessible information about the platform, and starting to engage with potential users and contributors. The objective is to lay the groundwork for the platform's development and foster a supportive ecosystem around it.
* **Launch Renet Ai App with private access:** This phase involves launching the Renet Ai app with private access, serving as an initial testing and refinement period. The objective is to gather feedback from a select group of early users, ensuring the app's functionality, usability, and security meet high standards before a public release. This controlled environment allows for focused improvements and sets the stage for a successful, broader launch.
* **Deploy $RAI token on Ethereum and launch on Uniswap:** This phase involves deploying the $RAI token on the Ethereum blockchain and launching it on Uniswap. The $RAI token is designed to facilitate transactions within the Renet Ai ecosystem, such as accessing GPU power or rewarding contributors. Launching on Uniswap will provide initial liquidity and open trading opportunities for the token. Importantly, this step marks the beginning of $RAI's integration into the decentralized finance ecosystem, with plans for the token to play a central role in the platform's future functionalities and incentives.
* **Build a strong community:** This phase focuses on nurturing and expanding the Renet Ai community through various engagement strategies. It involves creating platforms for discussion, sharing updates, and gathering user feedback. The aim is to build a strong, supportive, and engaged community that contributes to the platform's development, evangelizes it, and provides a network of support for users and developers alike. This community foundation is essential for fostering innovation and ensuring the platform's long-term success and sustainability.

### Phase 2: Global Launch & Momentum

* **Launch Renet Ai App:** Launching the Renet Ai app publicly marks a significant milestone, bringing us one step closer to our vision of democratizing AI development. With this launch, users can now harness our CPU & GPU nets and serverless on-demand GPUs to build their own AI models. This phase represents a major stride towards success for Renet Ai, empowering users with essential tools for innovation. Yet, it's important to remember that while this launch is a key achievement, our journey towards the ultimate goal of transforming AI infrastructure continues.
* **Strategic Marketing and Partnerships:** In this phase, Renet Ai focuses on amplifying its market presence and establishing strategic partnerships. Through targeted marketing campaigns, the aim is to highlight Renet Ai's unique value proposition, reaching potential users and collaborators. Simultaneously, forming partnerships with key industry players will enhance the platform's capabilities and extend its reach. This concerted effort in marketing and collaboration is vital for scaling the platform, driving adoption, and solidifying Renet Ai's position in the AI infrastructure ecosystem.
* **Scaling GPU & CPU availability:** This phase involves enhancing the infrastructure to support a greater number of GPU and CPU resources, ensuring scalability to meet the growing demand from users for computational power. By increasing availability, Renet Ai aims to accommodate more complex AI models and a larger user base, furthering its mission to democratize AI development through accessible high-performance computing.
* **Centralized Exchange Listings:** Aiming to increase the adoption of the $RAI token by listing it on centralized exchanges. This step is crucial as the $RAI token plays a significant role in the Renet Protocol, being the currency for decentralized on-demand access to GPU power. Listing on exchanges will make $RAI more accessible to users, facilitating its use within the Renet Ai ecosystem and driving wider adoption and recognition of its value.

### Phase 3: Development of Renet Protocol

* **Team Expansion for Protocol Development:** Target the strategic growth of the Renet Ai team to accelerate the development of its underlying protocols.&#x20;
* **Renet Protocol Architecture Creation:** Designing and implementing the Renet Protocol Architecture, which serves as the backbone of the Renet Ai platform. It focuses on creating a robust, scalable, and efficient framework to manage decentralized computing resources effectively. The architecture is designed to facilitate seamless interaction between users and the computational power they need for AI projects, ensuring reliability, security, and optimal performance across the network.
* **Renet Protocol Development:** The development of the Renet Protocol, is a new, innovative network designed for the buying and renting of GPU power, utilizing $RAI tokens as the primary currency. This groundbreaking protocol aims to create a seamless marketplace, enabling users to easily access or provide computational resources, and fostering a more connected and efficient ecosystem for AI development and computational tasks.
* **Comprehensive Testing and Optimization:** Focussing on rigorously testing and optimizing the Renet Protocol to ensure its reliability, efficiency, and security. It involves identifying and rectifying potential vulnerabilities, enhancing performance to handle high volumes of transactions, and ensuring the protocol's architecture supports seamless GPU power trading.
* **Security Audits and Bug Bounty Programs:** Conduct thorough security audits and initiate bug bounty programs to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities within the Renet Protocol. The aim is to ensure the highest level of security and reliability by engaging with the cybersecurity community to test the network's defenses against possible attacks.
* **Renet Protocol Launch:** The Renet Protocol Launch aims for a smooth rollout, emphasizing reliability and efficiency. Efforts will focus on ensuring a seamless transition for users to engage with the new network for GPU power trading, backed by comprehensive testing, security measures, and optimization strategies to guarantee a stable and secure launch environment.
