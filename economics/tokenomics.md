### Liquidity Pool | 90% | 90,000,000 RAI

To improve trading and ensure our tokens are readily available, we'll put 90% of our initial tokens into Uniswap's trading pool. This helps make trading easy and keeps a healthy amount of tokens available for everyone.

### Treasury | 7% | 7,000,000 RAI

We're setting aside 7% of our tokens for the project's savings to ensure we can keep improving and growing in the long run. This fund will help us develop new features, reward our community, and form valuable partnerships. It means we'll have the resources to adapt and expand, making our project stronger and more capable of facing future challenges.

### Advisors & Ambassadors | 3% | 3,000,000 RAI

We're setting aside 3% of our tokens for future advisors and ambassadors. This allows us to bring in experts and enthusiastic supporters later on, who can guide our project, encourage wider adoption, and help forge new partnerships. Their skills and connections are crucial for our growth, ensuring we have the advice and advocacy needed to succeed and make a bigger impact.
